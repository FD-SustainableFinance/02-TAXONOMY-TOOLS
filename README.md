# [2] TAXONOMY-TOOLS

### Introduction
This will evolve as a "Library of Interactive Taxonomy Tools" to support users for exploring and comparing taxonomy files - for human interaction and download of machine and human readable taxonomy files.

### Solidatus
The primary tool at present is provided by Solidatus. Their web tool allows for human users to interact with:
1. individual taxonomy files
2. mappings between different taxonomy files
3. visualise the taxonomies and mappings
4. inspect the actributes and mappings of taxonomies
5. export the taxonomy file code in various formats

### Projects
For access to the library and tools: 
1. go to [Taxonomy & Mappings Project](https://github.com/orgs/FD-SustainableFinance/projects/2)
2. go to [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/FD-SustainableFinance/projects) to see the full projects list as it evolves

### Project Types
We expect that the taxonomy project categories will expand as the marketplace evolves. Exmaples include:
- **Phase 1**: Market Frameworks, Standards, Regulations & Laws - the initial focus of the OS-SFT project
- **Phase 2**: Market Services: e.g. taxonomies for data vendors' data service, scoring, rating and risk methodologies
- **Phase 3**: Market Financial Instruments, for example:
  - Spot Carbon, Carbon Derivatives - On-exchange, OTC, Carbon Offsets, Futures, OTC-Cleared, OTC-Uncleared
  - Bonds with KPIs, e.g. coupon resets based on carbon emissions
  - Swaps with KPIs, e.g. coupon resets and look-back payment resets based on carbon emissions
- **Phase 4**: Organisational Control Frameworks@ Policies, Processes & Procedures
- **Phase 5**: Organisaitonal Risk Models: credit risk, market risk, collateral risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, etc

And so forth ...
