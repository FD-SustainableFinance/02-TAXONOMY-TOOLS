# [2] TAXONOMY-TOOLS

### Introduction
This will evolve as a "Library of Interactive Taxonomy Tools" to support users for exploring and comparing taxonomy files - for human interaction and download of machine and human readable taxonomy files.

### Solidatus
The primary tool at present is provided by Solidatus. Their web tool allows for human users to interact with:
1. individual taxonomy files
2. mappings between different taxonomy files
3. visualise the taxonomies and mappings
4. inspect the attributes and mappings of taxonomies
5. export the taxonomy file code in various formats

### Projects
For access to the library and tools: 
1. go to [Taxonomy & Mappings Project](https://github.com/orgs/FD-SustainableFinance/projects/2)
2. go to [Projects](https://github.com/orgs/FD-SustainableFinance/projects) to see the full projects list as it evolves
